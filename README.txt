My project fulfills the requirements as follows:
- My github shows multiple commits and changes.
=The link to play my game is here: https://no1ogic.github.io/D3-Physics/
-My data assets were all created in Pixilart by my own lack of creative depth.
=The game uses continuous and discrete inputs from the player.
=The player's goal can only be achieved by allowing the physics engine to run. Players must utilize timing and 
-intuition to get the highest score on each section.
=There are 3 physics based gameplay scenes in my game as well as transition scenes.
=Other scenes are used to contextualize gameplay and apply narrative structure.
